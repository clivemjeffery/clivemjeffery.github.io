## Welcome

Hi, I live and work in Yorkshire in the North of England. I love to teach, code, [read](books.html) and create, and always have a number of [projects](projects.html) on the go. These pages are to help me to keep track of [everything](posts.html) and present the good stuff well.

I publish using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with a theme by [Adam Dueck](http://www.adamdueck.com/).
