Having installed a new Rails development environment on the MacBook under El Capitan, I need to test it. What better way than with my idea for an online word boxing app. I'll need the Heroku toolbelt later, to verify deployment, and it shouldn't be long before I can try it.

In my head, up to now, the app was called WordBoxer. There is already a [website](http://wordboxer.com) there, along with one at [wordsinboxes](http://www.wordsinboxes.com) - looks like a defunct blog. So a new less, cluttered name idea was needed. A boxer is a pugilist, so how about WordPug. It puts me in mind of a little pug dog who rounds up the words and gets them into their boxes. I could have a cute mascot in a similar style the guardsman at [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io).

Here are some ideas; https://rfclipart.com/search.html?text=pug
