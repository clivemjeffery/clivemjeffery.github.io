This collection of podcast transcripts was a fascinating introduction to the world of modern philosophy. Reading the book, perhaps naturally, inspired me to try out the [actual podcasts](http://philosophybites.com) and the one I listened to was also interesting. The transcript versions have the advantage you can go at your own pace and re-read anything that was initially confusing.
