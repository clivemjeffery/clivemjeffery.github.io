This is an informative, refreshing and hopeful book with a more favourable approach to religion than its title might suggest.

It certainly offers a different viewpoint from Richard Dawkins, who gets something of a ticking off in its pages. I've respected Dawkins' adamantine atheism, albeit with a slight unease, since reading The Blind Watchmaker and other works, way back. Now, De Waal puts into words, and perhaps goes some way to explain, that unease.

{{ page.title }} presents compelling evidence that there is an evolutionary basis for the development of morality and ethics in higher order mammals. Bonobos, chimpanzees, elephants and dogs are shown to act altruistically and to show a sense of fairness. 

De Waal's approach is partly autobiographical, with insightful and occasionally hilarious anecdotes from his long career. It is also partly an art pilgrimage and critique, as he takes us on a tour of paintings by [Hieronymus Bosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_Bosch). He tempers these enjoyable asides with accessible summaries of the painstaking research that backs up his premise and with carefully chosen references to other writers on the subjects of evolution, ethics and atheism; Alain de Botton and Richard Dawkins being two I've read and recognised.

A good book that puts both science and religion in their places. These places being both more and less than either atheist or religious might expect.
