title: Finally Updated OS X

## El Capitan is on the iMac!

These were the stages.

### Manually ran the installer

Probably having given up on me ever taking the plunge, the App Store was now showing an error next to the El Capitan banner and the download with neither restart (probably a good thing) nor proceed to install (definitely a bad thing). The solution, offered on an Apple forum was to find the "Install OS X El Capitan" app in Applications and run that. Curiously enough, now that I've run it, it has disappeared! A similar file for Mavericks still exists and I'll delete that (saving over 5GB).

The install completed unattended and "About This Mac" reported 'OS X El Capitan' version 10.11.5

### Checked Mail

The first App I checked was Mail. Rosedene's IMAP account was fine but the same one for Office365 was not, showing a connection error and wanting hostname details before even showing any property pages. I removed it and reconnected using the Exchange template in Accounts. This worked perfectly; so there's one immediate benefit of El Capitan.

### Checked for more updates

Unlike Windows updates, doing one fairly old one, doesn't seem to have generated a repeating cycle of updating, only to find more updates waiting. There were 3 or 4 small ones for utilities and one for iMovie. The latter seemed to take 2 goes to install and stick and I've not opened it yet.

### Checked Heroku toolbelt

Didn't work. It was either moved aside or the path changed.

### Reinstalled Developer Tools

Followed the command line from [my install]({% post_url 2016-02-17-Ruby-on-Rails-Setup %}) on the Macbook. It worked and shows up in the App Store's recently installed log as XCode version 7.3.1

Having just re-read that post (from February!) I need to report success and link to the simple and very prototype [Walsey the WordPug](https://wordpug.herokuapp.com/).

### Wrote this and tried Jekyll

Jekyll worked without updates, though there may be some worth getting (check later). Deployment needs git, so I checked that.
