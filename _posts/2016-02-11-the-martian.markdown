I really enjoyed this book, it deserves its un-put-downable reputation and would be an ideal holiday book. The conversational diary style makes for easy reading yet still maintains intensity and excellently conveys the action.

Despite the obvious outcome, Weir's focus on the hero's incremetal problem solving and generally positive outlook make the story work. The science is plausible and superbly researched; you will almost certainly reach for Wikipedia to bone up on [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars).

I liked the 70's references, both explicit and implied. Did the potatoes remind anyone else of [Silent Running](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067756/)?
