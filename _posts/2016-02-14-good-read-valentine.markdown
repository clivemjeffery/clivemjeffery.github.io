## Style 1 : Substance 0

So I looked around for a new Jekyll theme. I found [Joshua Lande's post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) and got on to [Poole](http://demo.getpoole.com), quite liking [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com), especially in the orange colourway. There were some build issues but the bits I wanted pulled in to my existing Jekyll project OK.

I tried a little to integrate [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). Despite being familiar with Bootstrap and using it in other projects, it felt too much for a simple site.

Having played the field, this Valentine's Day, I'm now going out with [Good Clean Read](https://github.com/adueck/good-clean-read). I like her clean uncomplicated look (though I'm missing orange - maybe for links) and the minimalist ideal. Next will be tweaking the layout to suit the style. Oh, and picking out all the others.

There, some substance anyway!
