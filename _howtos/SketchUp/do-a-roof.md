title: Do A Roof
---
Here are instructions on how to add various types of roof to a cuboid shaped building box. Obviously, your cuboid comes with a flat roof as standard, but flat roofs are a bit rubbish.

### A Simple Pitched Roof
The easiest roof for a rectangular building is the simple pitched roof. Buildings with pitched roofs have *gable ends*, triangular shaped parts on the ends of the walls.

1. Use the **Line** tool to draw a line between the midpoints along the top.
2. Select the **Move** tool and hover over the new line until it turns blue.
3. Click the line and begin moving it up. While moving, hold down the up-arrow key on your keyboard to fix movement to the blue axis.
4. Stop when the roof looks right. 

### A Simple Hipped Roof
A hipped roof has a sloped face rising from each edge. There are no gable ends. The simplest type to add to your building box in SketchUp is the pyramidal hipped roof.

1. Use the **Line** tool to draw in the diagonals across the flat top of your building box.
2. Select the **Move** tool and hover over the centre of the cross until a green dot shows up. A hint will say 'Endpoint'.
3. Click and pull up to make the roof the right height. Lock to the blue axis by holding down the up-arrow key.

### Hipped with a Ridge
Hipped roofs that come to a point at the apex (or top) are not common. Buildings usually have a ridge along the roof. To make a hipped roof with a ridge, you need to make a different shape on top of the building box. There are quite a few ways to do this but here's one:

1. Use the **Line** tool to draw lines from each vertex of the top rectangle to the centre-point of each long edge. This will make two intersecting triangles on the roof.
2. Use the **Eraser** tool to delete the diagonal lines in the middle part of the roof, leaving triangles at each end.
3. Select the **Line** tool again and draw a line to connect points of each triangle. This will be the ridge.
4. Use the **Move** tool to pull up the ridge, keeping it to the blue axis with the up-arrow key.

### Cylindrical or Domed

For an unusual roof on a cuboid, you could try a half-cylinder. If your base building is a cylinder itself, then you can use a dome.
