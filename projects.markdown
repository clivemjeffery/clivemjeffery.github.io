# Projects

## School website

I work at [Norton Community Primary School](http://www.norton-pri.n-yorks.sch.uk) and maintain our website. It is a mixture of plain old HTML and XML jazzed up with a custom [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) theme.

## Learning gateway

I made a learning gateway and moderated social site for our pupils and staff. It is a [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) app hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

## CosyHutch

We need to keep our rabbits warm in winter so I made [CosyHutch](https://thingspeak.com/channels/75136) with a Raspberry Pi, some temperature sensors and a greenhouse heater.

## QBike

I love cycling and cycling gadgets. [QBike](https://github.com/clivemjeffery/qbike.git) is my hobby project to read and display heart rate against training zones. It also uses a Raspberry Pi.
