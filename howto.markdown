# How To
This is an area of work-in-progress. A place for all my text based how-to instructions. If possible, it will be an index to the _howtos collection.

I've got one started for [SketchUp](/howtos/SketchUp/do-a-roof.html). It is generating the top title from the subfolder name and has its own layout (albiet identical to post right now).

### Next Steps

* Automatically index the How To collection, hopefully by subfolder.
* Establish a good workflow for adding diagrams / screenshots and short videos.
