# How To
This is an area of work-in-progress. A place for all my text based how-to instructions. They are in a Jekyll collection and have their own layout that generates the top title from the subfolder name.

So far, there are two.

* A work in progress for [SketchUp](/howtos/SketchUp/do-a-roof.html).
* [2Code Quizzes](/howtos/2Code/make-a-simple-quiz.html) for Year 4.

### Next Steps

* Automatically index the How To collection, hopefully by subfolder.
* Establish a good workflow for adding diagrams / screenshots and short videos.
